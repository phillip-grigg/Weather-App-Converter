# Weather-App-Converter
a app that shows weather info for location in both Celsius and Fahrenheit and allows you temperature between C&F

This app uses asynchronous fetch function to take weather information from the accuweather API. accuweather requires an authentication key. I have removed the key from this file, which is contained on the first line of the forecast js file. If you wish to use this app, please go to https://developer.accuweather.com/ and create your own account, then follow the steps to get your own authentication key.
