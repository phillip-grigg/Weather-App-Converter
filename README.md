# Weather-App-Converter
a app built to be a google chrome extension that shows weather info for location in both Celsius and Fahrenheit and allows you temperature between C&F

This app uses asynchronous fetch function to take weather information from the accuweather API. accuweather requires an authentication key. I have removed the key from this file, which is contained on the first line of the forecast js file. If you wish to use this app, please go to https://developer.accuweather.com/ and create your own account, then follow the steps to get your own authentication key.

This app was build using The Net Ninja Weather App from his Udmey course (https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/) as a base to learn the asynchronous fetch function. I built apon his App to turn it into a temp converter with my own HTML, CSS, JS and Json file.
